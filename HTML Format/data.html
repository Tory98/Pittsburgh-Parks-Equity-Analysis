    API: Application Programming Interface. A way for computer programs to communicate with each other.

    Data collected from the 2018 U.S. Census at the Block Group Level.

    Censusu Block Group: the smallest unit for which data is made publically available. See below for map of Pittsburgh with Block group divisions.

        The Process:
    </p>
    <p id="Dubai-p">
        Collect coordinates of park entrances by hand.
    </p>
    <p id="Dubai-p">
        Feed coordinates to Google Maps API to get the travel time (walking, driving, and busing) from the center point of each Census Block Group to the every park entance. Keep the shortest time for the regression.

    </p>
        
    </div>
    <h2>Cell Phone Data</h2>
        <img src="celldata.png"  class="CellData">
    
    <p>The original cell data came with data for the entire country and over a hundred descriptive columns from 2018-2021. We filtered it down include only data for Pittsburgh parks and got rid of all but four columns: location_name, visitor_home_cbgs,raw_visitor_counts, and Month.
    <br><br>
        location_name describes the place of interest. Each location name is a different park. 
    <br><br>
        visitor_home_cbgs tells us what block group each visitor lives at. This is calculated based on where the cell phone that visited the park spends the night.
    <br><br>
        raw_visitor_counts tells us how many cell phones were pinged at the location over the course of a month.
    <br><br>
        Month tells us which month of the year this data was collected in.
        
    <br><br>
        NOTE: Because rules surrounding cell phone tracking changed over the period of our data collection, the cell phone data cannot be used to analyze trends over time. Because the rules changed at the same time for all block groups, it is still useful as a measure to compare block groups to each other.
